# Model Card

For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

Model Details - The model I utilized was the Random Forest Classifier, the Random Forest Classifier is a learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and merges their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. 

The dataset comes from the following link (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income). This dataset is based on the Census Income which was donated back in 1996. 

Intended Use - The intended use of this model, data, and overall project is for educational purposes. The data is intended to learn how to create a prediction task to see if a person based on their financial position. 

Training Data - The data was trained using the 80/20 rule, 80 percent of the dataset is being trained on while the other 20 is being tested on. 

Evaluation Data - The data was evaluated with the test dataset that was a part of the 20 percent mentioned before. 

Metrics - Below I have listed the metrics that were produced
    Precision: 0.7466 | Recall: 0.6053 | F1: 0.6686

Ethical Considerations - The dataset was taken back in 1996 therefore the data information is considerably out of date. 

Caveats and Recommendations - Caveat for this dataset is that it is almost 30 years out of the date which won't provide relevant information. A recommendation for this dataset is to utilize it mainly for educational and training purposes.
